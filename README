** Windows systems:

GPU parallelization is not  
currently available on Windows systems.


** Unix systems:

For full operational capabilities,
the 'uroot' package requires the following installed on the system:

  1) CUDA capable GPU with compute capability >= 3.0.
  
  2) CUDA software, which includes the 'nvcc' (release >= 7.1)
     NVIDIA Cuda Compiler driver (available at 
     http://www.nvidia.com/cuda).

  3) A general purpose C compiler is needed by nvcc.

By default the package is installed without the GPU capabilities.  To
request them, set environment variable CUDA_IGNORE to any nonempty value
for the R package installer.
